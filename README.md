# alsBargainBin

A PHP fun and colorful application simulating an online store front, MySQL Database, jQuery for validation and jQuery datepicker.

## Here's another PHP application.

Welcome to Al's Bargain Bin where you'll find all sorts of stuff you'll never need. You can add customers, view customers, 
add products, and place orders.

What else could you want?

It's all PHP with some jQuery for validation and a datepicker control.

In the sql folder you'll find the scripts for the db. Run those in your MySQL instance and then create/modify a user called dbuser with a password of dbuser with privileges of insert/select/update. If you'd prefer to use another user then change the login settings in Config.php in the php folder to the credentials you'll be using in this database.

Then drop the alsbargainbin folder into your localhost or web space and you should be good to go. 

If you are using web hosting and can't connect then you may need to change the server "localhost" in the Config.php file to whatever your hosting recommends.

Give it a whirl and enjoy.
